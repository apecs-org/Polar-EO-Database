# Polar-EO-Database
The [APECS Remote sensing project group](https://www.apecs.is/who-we-are/project-groups.html) initiated the Polar Remote Sensing
Database during the 2020-2021 term as a [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/) frontend with a
backend in the form of a [Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

Here, it is proposed to build upon this existing structure by considering the
Google sheet as an intermediary between the database backend, hosted here in the
form of [JSON](https://www.json.org) files, and the frontend created with Google services.
